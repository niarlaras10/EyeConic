# EyeConic
EyeConic will help its user to try on different glasses frame shapes and give information as an affirmation to the user. Designed specifically for those who use glasses or wanting to buy glasses, or just wanna being the next iconic person in this glass-y area!

If other virtual try on glasses implement AR or machine learning to give recommendations and enhance user experience, EyeConic aims to let the user decide what's best for them by giving them info for their own consideration and also trying on the glasses without much hassle!
